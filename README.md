## About The Project

[![Product screenshot](<Screenshot 2023-09-22 at 1.39.50 PM.png>)]

This project is part of the curriculum for Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree.

In this project I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive regfistration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I added JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

* Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity;
* Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
